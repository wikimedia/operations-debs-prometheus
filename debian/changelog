prometheus (0.14.0+ds-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix upstream version (it is a repackage, so it should be marked).
  * Un-vendor github.com/prometheus/log as it is now a separate package.
  * debian/control: Update prometheus/log package name.
  * debian/postrm: Do not remove directories forcefully, as these are shared
    with other prometheus tools.
