prometheus (0.16.2+ds-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=high

  * Breaking changes in this release:
   - Remove undocumented 2nd argument of the `delta` function.
   - Release tarballs now contain the built binaries in a nested directory.
   - The `hash_mod` relabeling action now uses MD5 hashes instead of FNV hashes
     to achieve a better distribution.
   - The DNS-SD meta label `__meta_dns_srv_name` was renamed to
     `__meta_dns_name` to reflect support for DNS record types other than
     `SRV`.
   - The default full refresh interval for the file-based service discovery has
     been increased from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
   - In relabeling, parts of a source label that weren't matched by the
     specified regular expression are no longer included in the replacement
     output.
   - Queries no longer interpolate between two data points. Instead, the
     resulting value will always be the latest value before the evaluation
     query timestamp.
   - Regular expressions supplied via the configuration are now anchored to
     match full strings instead of substrings.
   - Global labels are not appended upon storing time series anymore. Instead,
     they are only appended when communicating with external systems
     (Alertmanager, remote storages, federation). They have thus also been
     renamed from `global.labels` to `global.external_labels`.
   - The names and units of metrics related to remote storage sample appends
     have been changed.
   - The experimental support for writing to InfluxDB has been updated to work
     with InfluxDB 0.9.x. 0.8.x versions of InfluxDB are not supported anymore.
   - Escape sequences in double- and single-quoted string literals in rules or
     query expressions are now interpreted like escape sequences in Go string
     literals (https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_literals).
