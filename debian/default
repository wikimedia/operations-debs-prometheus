# Prometheus supports the following options:

#   -config.file "/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml"
#      Prometheus configuration file name.
#
# == ALERTMANAGER ==
#
#   -alertmanager.notification-queue-capacity 10000
#      The capacity of the queue for pending alert manager notifications.
#
#   -alertmanager.timeout 10s
#      Alert manager HTTP API timeout.
#
#   -alertmanager.url
#      Comma-separated list of Alertmanager URLs to send notifications to.
#
# == LOG ==
#
#   -log.format "logger:stderr"
#      Set the log target and format. Example:
#      "logger:syslog?appname=bob&local=7" or "logger:stdout?json=true"
#
#   -log.level "info"
#      Only log messages with the given severity or above. Valid levels:
#      [debug, info, warn, error, fatal].
#
# == QUERY ==
#
#   -query.max-concurrency 20
#      Maximum number of queries executed concurrently.
#
#   -query.staleness-delta 5m0s
#      Staleness delta allowance during expression evaluations.
#
#   -query.timeout 2m0s
#      Maximum time a query may take before being aborted.
#
# == STORAGE ==
#
#   -storage.local.checkpoint-dirty-series-limit 5000
#      If approx. that many time series are in a state that would require
#      a recovery operation after a crash, a checkpoint is triggered, even if
#      the checkpoint interval hasn't passed yet. A recovery operation requires
#      a disk seek. The default limit intends to keep the recovery time below
#      1min even on spinning disks. With SSD, recovery is much faster, so you
#      might want to increase this value in that case to avoid overly frequent
#      checkpoints. Also note that a checkpoint is never triggered before at
#      least as much time has passed as the last checkpoint took.
#
#   -storage.local.checkpoint-interval 5m0s
#      The time to wait between checkpoints of in-memory metrics and
#      chunks not yet persisted to series files. Note that a checkpoint is never
#      triggered before at least as much time has passed as the last checkpoint
#      took.
#
#   -storage.local.chunk-encoding-version 1
#      Which chunk encoding version to use for newly created chunks.
#      Currently supported is 0 (delta encoding), 1 (double-delta encoding), and
#      2 (double-delta encoding with variable bit-width).
#
#   -storage.local.dirty false
#      If set, the local storage layer will perform crash recovery even if
#      the last shutdown appears to be clean.
#
#   -storage.local.engine "persisted"
#      Local storage engine. Supported values are: 'persisted' (full local
#      storage with on-disk persistence) and 'none' (no local storage).
#
#   -storage.local.index-cache-size.fingerprint-to-metric 10485760
#      The size in bytes for the fingerprint to metric index cache.
#
#   -storage.local.index-cache-size.fingerprint-to-timerange 5242880
#      The size in bytes for the metric time range index cache.
#
#   -storage.local.index-cache-size.label-name-to-label-values 10485760
#      The size in bytes for the label name to label values index cache.
#
#   -storage.local.index-cache-size.label-pair-to-fingerprints 20971520
#      The size in bytes for the label pair to fingerprints index cache.
#
#   -storage.local.max-chunks-to-persist 0
#      Deprecated. This flag has no effect anymore.
#
#   -storage.local.memory-chunks 0
#      Deprecated. If set, -storage.local.target-heap-size will be set to
#      this value times 3072.
#
#   -storage.local.num-fingerprint-mutexes 4096
#      The number of mutexes used for fingerprint locking.
#
#   -storage.local.path "/var/lib/prometheus/metrics"
#      Base path for metrics storage.
#
#   -storage.local.pedantic-checks false
#      If set, a crash recovery will perform checks on each series file.
#      This might take a very long time.
#
#   -storage.local.retention 360h0m0s
#      How long to retain samples in the local storage.
#
#   -storage.local.series-file-shrink-ratio 0.1
#      A series file is only truncated (to delete samples that have
#      exceeded the retention period) if it shrinks by at least the provided
#      ratio. This saves I/O operations while causing only a limited storage
#      space overhead. If 0 or smaller, truncation will be performed even for a
#      single dropped chunk, while 1 or larger will effectively prevent any
#      truncation.
#
#   -storage.local.series-sync-strategy "adaptive"
#      When to sync series files after modification. Possible values:
#      'never', 'always', 'adaptive'. Sync'ing slows down storage performance
#      but reduces the risk of data loss in case of an OS crash. With the
#      'adaptive' strategy, series files are sync'd for as long as the storage
#      is not too much behind on chunk persistence.
#
#   -storage.local.target-heap-size 2147483648
#      The metrics storage attempts to limit its own memory usage such
#      that the total heap size approaches this value. Note that this is not a
#      hard limit. Actual heap size might be temporarily or permanently higher
#      for a variety of reasons. The default value is a relatively safe setting
#      to not use more than 3 GiB physical memory.
#
#   -storage.remote.graphite-address
#   -storage.remote.graphite-prefix
#   -storage.remote.graphite-transport
#   -storage.remote.influxdb-url
#   -storage.remote.influxdb.database
#   -storage.remote.influxdb.retention-policy
#   -storage.remote.influxdb.username
#   -storage.remote.opentsdb-url
#   -storage.remote.timeout
#      WARNING: THESE FLAGS ARE UNUSED!
#      Built-in support for InfluxDB, Graphite, and OpenTSDB has been removed.
#      Use Prometheus's generic remote write feature for building remote
#      storage integrations. See

#
# == WEB ==
#
#   -web.console.libraries "/etc/prometheus/console_libraries"
#      Path to the console library directory.
#
#   -web.console.templates "/etc/prometheus/consoles"
#      Path to the console template directory, available at /consoles.
#
#   -web.enable-remote-shutdown false
#      Enable remote service shutdown.
#
#   -web.external-url
#      The URL under which Prometheus is externally reachable (for
#      example, if Prometheus is served via a reverse proxy). Used for
#      generating relative and absolute links back to Prometheus itself. If the
#      URL has a path portion, it will be used to prefix all HTTP endpoints
#      served by Prometheus. If omitted, relevant URL components will be derived
#      automatically.
#
#   -web.listen-address ":9090"
#      Address to listen on for the web interface, API, and telemetry.
#
#   -web.local-assets "/usr/share/prometheus/web/"
#      Path to static assets/templates directory.
#
#   -web.max-connections 512
#      Maximum number of simultaneous connections.
#
#   -web.read-timeout 30s
#      Maximum duration before timing out read of the request, and closing
#      idle connections.
#
#   -web.route-prefix
#      Prefix for the internal routes of web endpoints. Defaults to path
#      of -web.external-url.
#
#   -web.telemetry-path "/metrics"
#      Path under which to expose metrics.
#
#   -web.user-assets
#      Path to static asset directory, available at /user.
